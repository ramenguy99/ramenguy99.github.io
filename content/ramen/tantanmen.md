This is one of my favorites, it was probably the first time that everything went smoothly. I am still really proud of it!

### Recipe

**Tare:**
- Tahini: I recommend trying to make homemade tahini if possible but I had to try a few times before getting it right.
- Soy sauce: go for a salty one in this case, this is the main salty component of the dish!
- Rice vinegar: just a bit to add an acid note.

Combine tahini and soy sauce whisking until they mix very well I'd say about 2/3 tahini 1/3 soy sauce, this should taste very salty, then add a tablespoon or a bit more vinegar, here it's very important to taste with the broth to get the desired flavour, I'd say about 2-3 tablespoons total per bowl. Whisk it very well with the broth before adding anything else to help it mix well.

**Broth:**
I went for a very clear chicken stock, using the All-Purpose Chintan recipe from [the book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLPoLxek3WLQJDtU6i3300_0nNioqeYXi7vESrtNvjQ/edit?usp=sharing).

**Chili oil:**
- Oil (any kind)
- Garlic
- Onion
- Ginger

Heat the desired amount of oil, you can use any kind of oil you prefer, I went for a light olive oil since that's the only one I had around, add 2 gloves of garlic (or more if you prefer) half an onion and a piece of ginger, keep on very low heat until vegetables start to brown, filter the oil still hot in a bowl with chili powder or flakes and whisk, let it sit there until it cools off, add more powder to get a darker color! Also I saved a bit of the oil with the remaining vegetables for cooking the pork, which turned out really good.

**Ground pork:**
I took 300g ground pork for 2 servings, heated the remaining oil from chili oil and cooked it until grey and added 1/4 cup sake, I then added a tablespoon chili oil, 1 tbsp miso and soy sauce to taste, for a bit more saltiness. Cook for about 10 mins.
