![thumbnail: shoyu ramen](thumbnail.jpeg)

I cooked this ramen with a bunch of friends. First time making ramen for 7 people. A friend brought his pasta machine just for the occasion, it was his first time cooking ramen and he wanted to learn as much as possible, we had to make fresh noodles. It took 3 people and 3 hours the day before to prepare the noodles, and the full afternoon and evening to prepare everything else the following day.

The result was really good and I was extremely happy everything worked out well even with so many servings.
