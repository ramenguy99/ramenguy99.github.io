My name is Dario Mylonopoulos, I am a software engineer at [Leica Geosystems](https://leica-geosystems.com/) working on firmware for 3D scanners, previously I was an intern in the rendering group at [Disney Research](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) in Zurich focusing on monte carlo light transport for offline rendering.

I am interested in all things related to computer graphics, systems and performance.
I sometimes [blog](/posts) about random projects and interesting things I come across.
I also cook [ramen](/ramen) with family and friends and post pictures of it here!
